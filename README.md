The Heck is a safe-for-work branch of a not very safe-for-work but useful tool available [here (NSFW)](https://github.com/nvbn/theheck)

Please refer to that link for in-depth documentation, on a personal device if necessary, but the gist is if you mess up a command - say "git psuh" - you can follow it with "heck" and it will run "git push" instead.
